# Initial project requirements

## Project definition

The aim of the project is to produce a simple turn-based dungeon crawler in 
which the player takes control of an adventurer and is cast down into a dungeon 
in search of valuable treasures. On their journey they will gather
equipment, fight enemies and over time become stronger the closer they
get to the treasures below.

## Features

- Randomly generated dungeon comprised of multiple levels
- Tile-based graphics and UI based on JavaFX
- Turn-based movement
- Player levels up as the game progresses
- Random loot: weapons, armor, potions
- Enemies of varying difficulty on all the levels of the dungeon
- High-score board
